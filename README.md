### Summary

Recommender systems are a computer-based, machine learning algorithm that collect user information and return products or services the user may be interested in for example, every time a user shops online, the recommender system is taking in what they may be interested in and returning similar items. (Shetty, 2019-2021)

Recommender systems make the task of scrolling through the internet, searching for what you want, much easier and cut down on time spent looking for items as well as introducing new items to users that they may not have thought of. This increases the userâ€™s time spent online as they are exposed to more of what they like and therefore, recommender systems collect more data from the knowledge they gain about the users.

The nearest neighbour algorithm is used for this recommender system.
Nearest neighbour algortihm is an unsupervised classifier also known as memory based system,
Because it memorizes instances and then recommends an item (a single instance), based on how quantitively similar it is to a new, incoming instance.

In this case, the producer has a specification for a particular artist they are looking for, 
The dataset has instances(items) that may match.
We need to create a single test point with producers specifications, this runs and finds the similar type within the dataset
using a Spotify dataset. Overall, it is looking to recommend artist based on features and recommending artists with features similar.
