    "## AI Application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will be discussing the strengths and limitations of AI Applications, reviewing what makes them useful in our lives and for the future and some of the damaging effects of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Intelligence is displayed by animals and humans. It is learned from a young age and developed naturally as we grow through experiences, people, and our surrounding environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence is machine powered intelligence. With AI the machine is given data relating to human intelligence, this data is taken and stored and then reused in certain situations to solve problems and give solutions. AI finds a way to use data intelligently which separates it from other machines that typically only store data and use it when prompted. AI can work a little more independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to describe it would be the simulation of human intelligence (Ed Burns, 2021).\n",
    "AI is also often referenced with machine learning. \n",
    "This is for the well-known practice of teaching an AI certain things to help build its intelligence e.g., AI powered chatbots. \n",
    "\n",
    "AI is also applied in many other ways through speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), machine vision and many more (Ed Burns, 2021). \n",
    "Some programming languages associated with AI include Python, Java, and R as the most widely used and well known (Ed Burns, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "__Continuous work:__ Artificial Intelligence is always available for executing tasks at any time of day or night. When humans can only work 4-6 hours a day and this is not including breaks (Kumar, 2019). \n",
    "After a full workday, humans eventually get tired and need to rest. An AI machine can go on working with no breaks and can continue carrying out the consistent amount of work without experiencing fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Fast Paced and Lack of Errors:__ AI machines are better at making decisions at a quicker pace than humans because they are mainly programmed to accurately execute every task quickly whereas humans make decisions based on both emotional and practical factors (Kumar, 2019), and these decisions may not always be so accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Multi-Tasking and Repetitive Jobs:__ AI machines allow for tasks to be completed at the same time. This type of multi-tasking ensures work is completed faster and reduces the amount of work that would take humans a longer time (Q&A, 2021). \n",
    "They are also good at executing repetitive jobs that humans may find tedious as well as dangerous jobs that could cause a normal person harm (Pedamkar, 2020). \n",
    "AI machines can recognise certain patterns and carry them out consistently and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Daily Use:__ Our phones are one of the tools that uses AI to make daily tasks easier. For example, after some time, keyboards on smartphones can predict what the user will type just from analysing their typing patterns, words often used and even some context to the sentence the user is typing (Pedamkar, 2020). \n",
    "This also includes social media, (Pedamkar, 2020), most platforms such as Instagram use an algorithm which considers what a user is interacting with often and recommends what it thinks they might like. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem-solving:__ AI is helping humans further solve problems that would initially take longer or require a large team. \n",
    "With the power if AI, new solutions in different industries are being found such as medicine, science, maths and many more (Kumar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "__Expensive:__ The amount of money that goes into creating an AI machine is immense and needs a lot of resources (Duggal, 2021). Resources such as hardware and software need to be maintained, repaired, and upgraded regularly which can be expensive over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Limited in New Ideas:__ AI is only able to carry out the tasks that it is programmed to achieve (Kumar, 2019). \n",
    "Unlike humans, they are unable to come up with new, innovative ideas if it does not exist within their machine system already. This is limiting in the number of choices machines can make without a human adding to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Job Loss:__ With AI being able to work faster, smarter, more efficient, longer, and more accurate than humans, this means a lot of jobs are at risk of having AI completely take over and a lot of job opportunities would be lost (Duggal, 2021). \n",
    "This especially includes repetitive factory jobs that may even include dangerous tasks. \n",
    "It would be easier to have a machine do it rather than a human as it would cut on costs, time, and lawsuits.\n",
    "Many jobs are now looking to replace less qualified workers with AI robots which can do the same job at a faster pace and leave no room for error (Kumar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Reducing Morale:__ With a lot of our mobile devices and other technologies that harness the use of AI power, more and more people find it tedious to do simple tasks (Duggal, 2021). \n",
    "The need to memorize numbers, words or solve puzzles is long gone and replaced with algorithms that can predict a user’s next move while they are still thinking it. \n",
    "Predictive algorithms also make certain platforms and applications more addictive and have many people, especially younger people, relying on their devices more than ever (Kumar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Lack of emotion:__ Where emotions can be a weakness sometimes for humans in certain situations, it can also be a great strength when it comes to making more complex decisions that are not as simple for an algorithm to come up with a solution. \n",
    "Morals and ethics are human traits that need to be inputted into AI machines and this is not always an easy task (Duggal, 2021).\n",
    "AI also lack the ability to be able to network with other humans and build a strong foundation for a team that can result in new ideas being formed. \n",
    "Human connection is an integral part of communication in many workspaces, which AI machines are not able to execute themselves (Kumar, 2019). "

    "## Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are a computer-based, machine learning algorithm that collect user information and return products or services the user may be interested in for example, every time a user shops online, the recommender system is taking in what they may be interested in and returning similar items. (Shetty, 2019-2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems make the task of scrolling through the internet, searching for what you want, much easier and cut down on time spent looking for items as well as introducing new items to users that they may not have thought of. This increases the user’s time spent online as they are exposed to more of what they like and therefore, recommender systems collect more data from the knowledge they gain about the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "A person’s brain releases dopamine or ‘feel good’ chemical responses when faced with things they enjoy, and this comes easy while scrolling through the internet (BetterHealth, 2021). Many applications and social media platforms use recommender systems because they play a big role in entertaining these chemical responses that keep users engaged and give a better user experience (BetterHealth, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of recommender systems. In this chapter, both collaborative based and content-based recommender systems will be discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Based\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of collaborative based filtering systems. Collaborative based recommender systems look at the similarities in both users and items (Google Developers, 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this means that users with similar interests can influence each other’s recommendations for example, if both users like Taylor Swift and one user starts listening to Macklemore, the other user may also be recommended Macklemore. Furthermore, recommendations can also be made based on what items or content the user continues to interact with most. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user will then be recommended similar items or content relating to what they currently like (Mohd Abdul Hameed, 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    " - This style of recommender is good because it focuses mainly on the content/items the user has shown interests in (Dangeti, 2021).\n",
    " \n",
    " - Even if there are no items on the user has interacted with, the recommender system can still make recommendations based on what is popular to other users (Dangeti, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    " - Depends on having enough users to start engaging with items/content. They need users to interact with items to make recommendations.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Would not make recommendations based on user’s personal interests e.g., if a new user who likes horror movies keeps getting recommended comedy movies because that’s what is popular among other users on the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Based\n",
    "\n",
    "Content based recommender systems look at what the users’ interests are. \n",
    "They mainly focus on combining the users interests and the products/services available and providing unique recommendations suited to the user (Iterators, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender also keeps track of what the user has shown interest in the most in the past and makes recommendations based on what items/services the user liked (Iterators, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    " - Content based recommender systems do not always require a user to directly interact with the items/content as it will mostly be looking at the user’s profile (Pasquale Lops, 2011).\n",
    " \n",
    " - They can recommend new content that has not yet received any rating from users, once again it is recommending based on what interests the user has provided (Pasquale Lops, 2011).\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    " - Relies on a user sharing their interests within their user profile to start making recommendations. Harder for recommendations to be made to inactive users or users who have not finished setting up their profile.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Depends on new users interacting with content consistently to build up more accurate recommendations (Pasquale Lops, 2011)."

    "\n",
    "From this chapter, the types of recommender systems were explored and how they relate to AI. The applications of AI were also discussed and finally a content based recommender system was built using the Nearest Neighbour algorithim. From research on this topic, it is clear that many algorithms exist for building recommender systems. Nearest Neighbour algorithm was chosen for this CA as it was clear and concise in terms of learning how content based recommendations work and how the machine is able to give accurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future projects, the aim would be to explore more algorithms and methods of building recommender systems and expanding knowledge on how they work and the different calculations and methods that go into creating them."
